realtime editor is project to create a simple HTML and CSS editor.

This tool was initially made to create quick sections of a web page like a header, menus, layouts and see a result real time in a real browser window.

I found this tool useful when teaching HTML or CSS, because you can see all the code and the result without switching between programs and using and a simple textbox.

Thanks to Codemirror (http://codemirror.net) for the text editor implemented in JavaScript, this makes teaching HTML easier and makes coding more confortable.
